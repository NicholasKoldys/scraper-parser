Scraper Parser - Google Chrome Extension
=============

This is a simple google chrome extension for scraping a website for a very particular html element/node and formats the result based on its inner text, while also copying the text content to the user's clipboard.

**This is a very early iteration of the project and is not considered as a release.**
